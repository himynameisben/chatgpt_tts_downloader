# Curl Command Downloader

This Python script reads curl commands from files in the `curl_commands` folder, downloads the corresponding files, and saves them to the `output` folder. Once downloaded, the curl command file is moved to the `downloaded` folder. If the folders do not exist, they are created automatically.

## Description

This script can be used to download text-to-speech (TTS) audio files from chatGPT. By placing curl commands that request TTS audio files into the `curl_commands` folder, the script automates the download process and organizes the files for you.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

Install the required library using:

```sh
pip install requests
```
````

## Usage

1. **Place Curl Commands:**

   - Create a folder named `curl_commands`.
   - Place text files containing your curl commands in this folder. Each file should contain one curl command.

2. **Run the Script:**

   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```sh
     python batch_download.py
     ```

3. **Check Downloaded Files:**
   - The downloaded files will be saved in the `output` folder.
   - The original curl command files will be moved to the `downloaded` folder.

## How to Obtain Curl Commands for OpenAI TTS

To download TTS audio files from OpenAI, you need to obtain the appropriate curl commands. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using your browser's Developer Tools:

1. **Open Developer Tools:**

   - In your browser (e.g., Chrome), right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac) to open Developer Tools.

2. **Go to the Network Tab:**

   - In Developer Tools, navigate to the "Network" tab.

3. **Perform the Action to Trigger the Request:**

   - Click the 'Read Aloud' button under gpt's reply to generates the TTS audio.

4. **Find the Request:**

   - Look for the network request that corresponds to the TTS audio. It will typically be a `synthesize` request.

5. **Copy the Curl Command:**

   - Right-click on the request and select "Copy" -> "Copy as cURL".

6. **Save the Curl Command:**
   - Paste the copied curl command into a text file and save it in the `curl_commands` folder.

## Script Explanation

- **Folders:**

  - `curl_commands`: Contains the input curl command files.
  - `downloaded`: Contains the processed curl command files.
  - `output`: Contains the downloaded files.

- **Function `download_file_from_curl(curl_command, output_filename)`:**
  - Parses the URL and headers from the curl command.
  - Sends an HTTP GET request to download the file.
  - Saves the downloaded file with the given output filename.
  - Returns `True` if the download is successful, otherwise `False`.

## Notes

- Ensure your curl commands are correctly formatted and that the headers and tokens are valid.
